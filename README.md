# HNP Clementine 1.0.0 by Antonio Prcela (github precla) based on HNP 2.0.1

HNP (HexChat Now Playing) is a now playing announcer for HexChat and
Clementine capable of showing detailed info about the current playing
track.

The original HNP combined with Amarok has the following features, which
haven't all yet been migrated to Clementine. The most used ones work!

Original text from the HNP+Amarok features:
It displays the title, artist, album, year, length, bitrate
and size of the track with the possibility to choose which one to be
displayed or not. It is highly configurable through various commands and
it also has a graphical menus interface.

## Usage
1. copy the hnp_clementine.pl file into the ~/.config/hexchat/addons directory.
2. load it in Hexchat, for example using: `Window -> Plugin and Scripts`
